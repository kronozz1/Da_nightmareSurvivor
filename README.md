## How It Work
Uses JavaScript to develop this game,including web3.js.
Uses IPFS to host the web3 game and save its logs.
Uses chainlink to genarate random number for smart contracts and the game logic.
Develops smart contracts using Polygon testnet and Rinkby network.
Most importantly,I designed the monster generation algorithm through the random numbers.So every round is random and every game is an endless battle for survival.

## Future Work
Design more character skills and monster types.
Add NFTs to Game Design.
Improve the incentive mechanism of the game
Go to Ethereum or Polygon Mainnet.
